# Health-care-Analytics
🏥 End-to-End Healthcare Analytics & Predictive Modeling Project

Predicting 30-Day Hospital Readmissions Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a major concern in healthcare systems, leading to higher treatment costs, resource overload, and poor patient outcomes.

This project focuses on building a complete end-to-end healthcare analytics pipeline to predict 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetes patients using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

The project covers the entire analytics lifecycle from raw data ingestion to final model deployment-ready outputs.

🎯 Business Objective

Predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days

Identify key clinical and demographic risk factors

Provide actionable insights for hospital management

Enable early risk stratification for better patient care planning

🧠 Key Problem Statement

Can we accurately predict 30-day hospital readmission risk using patient demographics, clinical history, and treatment patterns?
